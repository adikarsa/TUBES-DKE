A new leak confirms Radeon RX 500 series specifications along with a new dual-fan reference design. Four cards are being prepared for launch next week, including RX 580/570/560 and RX 550.

AMD Radeon RX 580

AMD decided to compare RX 580 to R9 380 series. As you can see, the specifications we posted almost a month ago were spot on. The RX 580 has a base clock of 1257 MHz and boost clock of 1340 MHz. Itâ€™s confirmed to be Polaris based with 36 Compute Units (2304 Stream Processors). The RX 580 has up to 8GB of GDDR5 memory across 256-bit interface.

AMD Radeon RX 570

Meanwhile, the RX 570 has a boost clock up to 1244 MHz with 32 Compute Units enabled and 4GB GDDR5 memory by default, but similar to RX 580, RX 570 will be offered in 4GB and 8GB variant.

AMD Radeon RX 560

Moving on to Polaris 11. As it turns out the RX 560 has full chip, so 1024 Stream Processors (RX 460 had 896 cores). This card will be offered with up to 4GB of GDDR5 memory. This model is clocked at 1175/1275 MHz, a moderate performance boost over RX 460.

AMD Radeon RX 550

Finally, the RX 550, based on Polaris 12 has 512 Stream Processors and 2GB of GDDR5 memory across 128-bit interface. When it comes to the clock speeds, AMD only revealed the boost clock of 1183 MHz.
