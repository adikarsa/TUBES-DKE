SK Hynix updates memory product catalog, HBM2 available in Q1 2017

3D-NAND V4

Since November, SK Hynix lists 3D-NAND V4 with 72 cell layers and 256 Gbit in its catalog. This memory type was originally planned for Q2 2017, and according to to the latest product catalog, this schedule has not changed. In addition, 512 Gbit type is planned but for a fourth quarter.

FLASH will have a priority over DRAM

Global demand for NAND flash sees a great potential growth for memory manufacturers. The demand is still higher than supply, which unfortunately affects the prices of all memory types on the market. For SK Hynix over 72% of total sales were generated by DRAM, whereas NAND Flash was only responsible for 25% of sales. This proportion will probably not change very soon for Hynix, as recently announced factory construction will not be finished till 2019.

High Bandwidth Memory 2

HBM2 memory has been in Hynix databook for quite some time. However what is hard to explain is the data (oh the irony) it shows.
